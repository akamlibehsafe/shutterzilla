# Key Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-01-12 | **Adopt a Teal-based Primary Color Scheme** | The teal color (`#0d9488`) was chosen to evoke a sense of modernity and trust, differentiating the platform from more traditional vintage camera sites. It provides a vibrant accent against the clean, minimal gray and white layout. |
| 2026-01-12 | **Standardize on a Single Top Bar and Footer** | A consistent top bar and footer across all application pages (excluding landing/auth) ensures a predictable user experience and reinforces the brand identity. The top bar provides global navigation, while the footer offers access to legal and informational pages. |
| 2026-01-13 | **Separate Scraper and Collection into Two Distinct Apps** | Instead of a single, monolithic interface, the core functionalities were split into two applications accessible from a central App Switcher. This simplifies the user journey for each primary task—browsing listings versus managing a personal collection—and allows for more focused feature development. |
| 2026-01-13 | **Use HTML/CSS for Prototypes Instead of a Design Tool** | Building prototypes directly in HTML and CSS allows for immediate testing of responsiveness and interaction. It also provides a head start for the development team, as the structure and styling can be directly adapted for the final implementation. |
| 2026-01-13 | **Implement a Multi-Source Scraper with Visual Badges** | To provide comprehensive market data, the scraper aggregates listings from Buyee and eBay. Each source is clearly identified with a colored badge, giving users at-a-glance information about the listing's origin. |
| 2026-01-13 | **Fix Inconsistent Footer Logo** | The initial footer on the legal pages (`about.html`, `privacy.html`, `terms.html`) used an inline SVG for the logo, which was inconsistent with the rest of the site. This was corrected to use the standard `logo-footer.png` image to ensure brand consistency. |
| 2026-01-13 | **Link Profile Icon to Admin Dashboard** | To provide a consistent and intuitive way for administrators to access the backend, the user profile icon in the top bar of all application pages now links directly to the `admin_dashboard.html`. This simplifies navigation and makes the admin section easily discoverable. |
| 2026-01-XX | **Use Vue.js for Frontend** | Vue.js was specified as the frontend framework. Vue 3 with Composition API, Vite, Vue Router, Pinia, and TypeScript provide a modern, type-safe, and maintainable frontend architecture. |
| 2026-01-XX | **Use Node.js + TypeScript for Backend** | Node.js with Express.js and TypeScript chosen for backend API. This allows code sharing between frontend and backend (both JavaScript/TypeScript), simplifies development, and leverages the extensive npm ecosystem. |
| 2026-01-XX | **Use Supabase for Database, Auth, and Storage** | Supabase provides PostgreSQL database, built-in authentication (email/password + OAuth), and file storage in a single service. The free tier (500MB database, 1GB storage) is sufficient for the initial 10-user target, and it eliminates the need for separate auth and storage services. |
| 2026-01-XX | **Use Vercel for Hosting** | Vercel's free tier (unlimited personal projects) provides automatic deployments from GitHub, serverless functions for the API, CDN for static assets, and preview deployments for feature branches. This eliminates server management and provides a modern deployment workflow. |
| 2026-01-XX | **Use Python + GitHub Actions for Web Scraping** | Python with BeautifulSoup/Playwright chosen for scraping due to excellent tooling. GitHub Actions provides free scheduled execution (2,000 minutes/month) for running scrapers every 4 hours, eliminating the need for a separate server or cron job setup. |
| 2026-01-XX | **Use Resend for Email Sending** | Resend's free tier (3,000 emails/month) provides modern API, great deliverability, and domain verification. Configured to send from `@shutterzilla.com` with SPF/DKIM records. |
| 2026-01-XX | **Use Zoho Mail Free + Gmail Forwarding for Email Receiving** | Zoho Mail Free provides `hello@shutterzilla.com` with forwarding to personal Gmail. This eliminates the need for a paid Google Workspace or Microsoft 365 account while keeping all emails in one place (Gmail). |
| 2026-01-XX | **Include Social Login (OAuth) from the Start** | Google and Facebook OAuth authentication included from project start for learning purposes and user convenience. Supabase Auth handles the OAuth flow, eliminating custom implementation. |
| 2026-01-XX | **Use Simplified Deployment Strategy (main branch = production)** | Instead of separate dev/test/prod environments, use `main` branch for production and feature branches for preview deployments. This reduces complexity for solo dev + AI workflow while maintaining testing capabilities through preview URLs. |
| 2026-01-XX | **Store Database Migrations in GitHub** | Database migrations stored in `supabase/migrations/` folder in GitHub repository. This provides version control for schema changes, enables easy rollback, and keeps all code (frontend, backend, database) in one place. |
| 2026-01-XX | **Use Cloud Supabase Projects (No Local Docker)** | Connect directly to Supabase cloud projects (`shutterzilla-dev` and `shutterzilla-prod`) instead of running local Docker containers. This simplifies setup and eliminates local infrastructure management, with the trade-off of requiring internet connection for development. |
| 2026-01-XX | **Use Sentry for Error Tracking** | Sentry's free tier (5,000 events/month) provides error tracking for both frontend (Vue.js) and backend (API) with stack traces, user context, and email alerts. Essential for monitoring application health. |
| 2026-01-XX | **Prioritize Free Tier Services** | All technology choices prioritize free tiers suitable for a small user base (max 10 users). Total monthly cost is $0, with clear upgrade paths when the project scales. This aligns with the friends/family project scope and cost-conscious approach. |
